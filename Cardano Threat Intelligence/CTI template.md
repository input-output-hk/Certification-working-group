# CTI-YYYY-AAA-TTNN: The Vulnerability/Weakness Title

Change the CTI reference method to appropriate format.

## Author

Provide information about the person or team who found the vulnerability/weakness. This may include the names and roles of the individuals involved, their organization or company, and their contact information. It may also include any relevant certifications or qualifications held by the individuals or team.  

### Summary

Provide a brief summary of the vulnerability/weakness finding, including a descriptive title that accurately describes the vulnerability/weakness found.

### Description

Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability/weakness, including the system or software affected, and how it was discovered. Include any relevant background information that may help stakeholders understand the problem. Also, describe the impact of the vulnerability/weakness. Use clear and concise language to help stakeholders understand the problem.

### Risk Assessment

- **Likelihood:** Assess the probability of the vulnerability/weakness being exploited or an attack being successful. The Likelihood levels can be defined as follows:
  - **Low:** The likelihood of a vulnerability/weakness being exploited is considered low, either because the vulnerability/weakness is difficult to find or because it would require a sophisticated attacker to exploit it.
  - **Medium:** The likelihood of a vulnerability/weakness being exploited is considered medium, meaning that an attacker with some level of skill could potentially exploit it.
  - **High:** The likelihood of a vulnerability/weakness being exploited is considered high, meaning that an attacker with minimal skill could potentially exploit it.

- **Difficulty:** Evaluate the difficulty of exploiting the vulnerability/weakness, including the level of skill and resources required by an attacker to carry out an attack.The Difficulty  levels can be defined as follows:
  - **Low:** The difficulty of exploiting a vulnerability/weakness is considered low, meaning that the attacker could easily exploit the vulnerability/weakness with minimal resources.
  - **Medium:** The difficulty of exploiting a vulnerability/weakness is considered medium, meaning that the attacker would require some level of expertise or resources to exploit it.
  - **High:** The difficulty of exploiting a vulnerability/weakness is considered high, meaning that the attacker would require significant expertise or resources to exploit it.

Combining likelihood and difficulty factors can help to determine the overall risk level of a vulnerability/weakness. For example, a vulnerability/weakness with a high likelihood and low difficulty would be considered a high-risk vulnerability/weakness, as it is both likely to be exploited and relatively easy to do so. On the other hand, a vulnerability/weakness with a low likelihood and high difficulty would be considered a lower-risk vulnerability/weakness, as it is less likely to be exploited and would require significant resources and expertise to do so.

- **Impact:** Evaluate the potential impact of the vulnerability/weakness on the system, organization, and users, ranging from Low to High.The impact levels can be defined as follows:
  - **Low:** Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses that have minimal impact on system confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
  - **Medium:** Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses that have moderate impact on system confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
  - **High:** Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses that have significant impact on system confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

As part of your risk assessment, describe the potential impact of the vulnerability/weakness on the organization and any potential legal or regulatory consequences/

- **Severity:** Assign a severity level to the vulnerability/weakness based on the risk assessment, ranging from High to Informational.The severity levels can be defined as follows:
  - **High:** Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses that can be easily exploited with a high impact.
  - **Medium:** Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses that can be exploited with some effort or have moderate impact.
  - **Low:** Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses that require significant effort to exploit or have low impact.
  - **Informational:** Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses that do not pose a significant risk by themselves but may provide useful information for attackers or reveal deficiencies in the security posture of the system.

Note that the severity level should be determined based on the combined assessment of likelihood/difficulty and impact.

### Steps to Reproduce

Provide a detailed guide on how to reproduce the vulnerability/weakness. The guide should include step-by-step instructions. Provide all relevant information to allow stakeholders to replicate the vulnerability/weakness, including information on the system environment,tools and tests used to reproduce the vulnerability/weakness.

### Technical Details

Include any technical details relevant to the vulnerability/weakness. This may include following technical details that are relevant to the vulnerability/weakness:

- Tools used
- Methodology (methods used to identify the vulnerability/weakness)
- Affected software versions
- Smart contracts that contain vulnerable code.
- Affected system configurations
- Blockchain networks using smart contracts.
- Examples of vulnerable code snippets.

Use technical language that stakeholders can understand but be as specific as possible. Also provide information about other type of vulnerabilities/weaknesses that may be related to or caused the CTI vulnerability/weakness (i.e., buffer overflow, SQL injection) and the attack vector used to exploit it.

### Mitigation & Remediation Steps

List recommended remediation steps to fix the vulnerability/weakness. Include any recommended patches, software updates, changes to system configuration or coding best practice that will fix the vulnerability/weakness. Describe how long the fix will take, the resources needed for implementation, and any potential implementation challenges. Also, recommend any workarounds (code snippets if needed) to mitigate the consequences of the vulnerability/weakness while the fix is being implemented.

### References

Include any relevant references or sources used during the vulnerability/weakness assessment, such as vendor advisories, known vulnerability/weakness databases, and industry-standard security guidelines and best practices.
